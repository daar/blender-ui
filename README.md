# blender-ui
Blender mockups in web format

For faster templating, this uses [Pug](https://pugjs.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), compiled with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). All available as npm packages.

* Clone this repo
* run ```npm install``` (if you're in Ubuntu you might need node-legacy)
* ```gulp && gulp watch``` (so it compiles Sass once and reloads as you save)
